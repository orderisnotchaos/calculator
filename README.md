# calculator
this is a simple calculator that recieves a string of text and calculates itÂ´s corresponding value (if syntax is correct)

# compiling
I use gcc but use your prefered c compiler and type

(your compiler) operators.c functions.c main.c -o prog

and that should be it. You should now have the prog file which should be an executable
